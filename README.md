## Hey there! 👋

I'm currently studying computer science and math at the University of Maryland with a minor in sociology. 

I've pinned some diverse repos. I've also made contributions to Visual Studio Code documentation, the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) [Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and many [other](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ablueputty01&type=pullrequests) open source projects. 

Prev. full stack @ [Amazon](https://amazon.com), [Viasat](https://viasat.com), and frontend @ [Planetary](https://planetary.co).
