## Hey there! 👋

I'm currently studying computer science and math at the University of Maryland with a minor in sociology. 

I've pinned some diverse repos. I've also made minor contributions to Visual Studio Code documentation, the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs, and many other open source projects. 

Prev. full stack @ [Amazon](amazon.com), frontend with a bit of infra @ [Viasat](viasat.com), and frontend @ [Planetary](planetary.co).

Check out [byalexyang.com](https://byalexyang.com) for my freelance work, reflections, and contacts. 

Hope you enjoy!
